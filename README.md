Space-Aachen: Project Scorpius
Welcome to the Space Team Aachen repository for Project Scorpius. This document provides an overview of our mission, team structure, and the key components of our project.

## Mission
SCORPIUS (named for the resemblance between a scorpionâ€™s tail and our rover's robotic arm) marks the first rover project by STA. Our goal is to compete in the European Rover Challenge (ERC) in Kielce, Poland, alongside teams from universities worldwide.

Our rover will be a standalone, mobile platform weighing under 75 kg, capable of both manual and fully autonomous operation. It will be designed to withstand moderate to harsh weather conditions and navigate challenging terrains.

## Team Structure
The project is divided into three main teams: Avionics, Software, and Mechanics.

## Avionics
The Avionics team is responsible for developing all necessary electronic features of the rover. The team is organized into several subsystems, each playing a critical role:

* Electrical Power System (EPS): Features sophisticated battery protection and supplies power to all actuators and motors.
* Communication System (COM): Manages data transmission between the rover and the Ground Station (GST).
* On-Board Data Handling (OBDH): Processes sensor data, saves it, and forwards it to the COM.
* Ground Station (GST): Remotely controls the rover and continuously processes data received from it.
## Software
The Software team implements all the software components required for the rover's operation, including:

* Locomotion control
* Mode switching between autonomous and manual
* Imaging and vision systems
* Communication with ground systems
* Display lamp outputs based on different modes
## Key functionalities:

Control of rover locomotion and the end effector for handling objects and drilling tasks
Processing imaging data from the rover's vision systems
Enabling both autonomous and manual operations
Facilitating communication with ground systems
Mechanics
The Mechanics team focuses on the physical construction and functionality of the rover, divided into four subsystems:

Frame: Constructs the torso of the rover, ensuring all components are securely connected and the electronic units are properly housed.
Locomotion: Develops a system for navigating rough terrain, keeping the rover stable and mobile.
Drilling Unit: Creates a system to drill a 30 cm deep hole, collect soil samples, and ensure sample purity.
Manipulator System: Interfaces with control panels to operate switches, measure voltages, and collect samples. This subsystem acts as the 'arm' of the rover.
